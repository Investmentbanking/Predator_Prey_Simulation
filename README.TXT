PROJECT TITLE: 
Predator/Prey Simulation

AUTHORS: 
Lavish Kamal Kumar and Ayesha Dorani

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: 
A Predator-Prey Simulation involving seven actors (5 animal species and 2 plant species):
Monkey, Sloth, Algae, Jaguar, Tree, Fish and Eagle in an enclosed rectangular field. 
Monkeys and sloths both feed on the same type of plant which are trees. Jaguars and eagles both 
feed on the same prey which are the sloths. On top of this, jaguars feed on fish and eagles feed 
on monkeys. Finallt, the fish feed on algae. There are two biomes which include the rainforest and river biome. 
The river biome is located at the bottom of the field and the rainforest biome makes up the rest of the field.
This allows for a more realisic envrioment as only certain actors are able to enter certain biomes just like
in the real world.

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:
- The program can either be started by calling the Main method of the Main class or by
creating a new SimulatorView object with either the default height and width or a 
given height and width by the user.

USER INSTRUCTIONS:
Once the project has been started the user will be presented with the simulation through a GUI
- The "Go" button which runs the simulation.
- The "Stop" button halts the simulation.
- The "Next Step" button is used to increment the simulation by one step.
- The "Reset" button resets the simulation and randomly populates the grid.
- The "Pie Chart" button displays the live pie chart.
- The "Quit" button halts and closes the program.
- The "Select Simulation Speed" JComboBox allows the user to change the simulation speed.
- A number of JComboBox's are presented on the right hand side of the GUI for both animals
and plants which allows the user to change the strength of disease, disease spread rate, 
mutation probability and mutation type which will affect the simulation.
- The "View" menu allows the user to select what organisms they wish to see in the simulation.
- Once the simulation ends a dialog box pops up which shows the user the simulation results.
